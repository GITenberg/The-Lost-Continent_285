description: "The Lost Continent: The Story of Atlantis is a fantasy novel by C. J.\
  \ Cutcliffe Hyne. It is considered one of the classic fictional retellings of the\
  \ story of the drowning of Atlantis, combining elements of the myth told by Plato\
  \ with the earlier Greek myth concerning the survival of a universal flood and restoration\
  \ of the human race by Deucalion.\nThe novel was published first in serial form\
  \ in Pearson's Magazine in the issues for Julyâ€“December 1899, and in hardcover book\
  \ form by Hutchinson (London) and Harpers (New York) in 1900. There have been several\
  \ editions since. Its importance in the history of fantasy literature was recognized\
  \ by its reissuing by Ballantine Books as the forty-second volume of the celebrated\
  \ Ballantine Adult Fantasy series during February 1972. Subsequent editions were\
  \ issued by Oswald Train in 1974 and by Bison Books in 2002. The Ballantine edition\
  \ includes an introduction by Lin Carter, and the Bison edition one by Harry Turtledove.\
  \ The novel was also reprinted (somewhat abridged) in the magazine Famous Fantastic\
  \ Mysteries (Dec. 1944), and in the anthology Science Fiction by the Rivals of H.\
  \ G. Wells by Castle Books in 1979.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
